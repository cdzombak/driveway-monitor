- If it looks like an Amazon delivery vehicle, its type is "Amazon delivery". Notes: Any vehicle with the word "prime" on it is an Amazon delivery vehicle. Any vehicle with Amazon's logo on it is an Amazon delivery vehicle. A vehicle that looks like a passenger car is NOT an Amazon delivery vehicle.

- If it looks like a FedEx delivery vehicle, its type is "FedEx delivery". Note: Any dark-colored vehicle is NOT a FedEx delivery vehicle.
- If it looks like a USPS delivery vehicle, its type is "USPS delivery". Note: Any dark-colored vehicle is NOT a USPS delivery vehicle.

- If it looks like a pizza delivery vehicle, its type is "pizza delivery".
- If it looks like a contractor's truck, plumber's truck, electrician's truck, or a construction vehicle, its type is "contractor".

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with exactly two keys, "desc" and "error":

- "desc" will contain the vehicle type you identified/described. If you could not identify or describe the vehicle, "desc" is "unknown". If there was no vehicle in the image, "desc" is an empty string ("").
- IF AND ONLY IF you could not identify the vehicle, "error" will describe what went wrong. If you identified the vehicle's type, do not provide any error message.
